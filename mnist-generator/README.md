# DCGAN for Handwritten Digit Generation (Digit '8')

This project aims to develop a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) capable of generating realistic handwritten digits. Specifically, the focus is on generating the digit '8' from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Given resource constraints, the training is restricted to images of the digit '8' only, with the model being implemented in Keras and trained in a Google Colab environment using a T4 GPU for computational efficiency.

The dataset was preprocessed by isolating all images labeled as '8', from both the training and test sets of MNIST. These images were normalized and reshaped before being passed into the model. The architecture consists of two key components: the discriminator and the generator. The discriminator is a convolutional neural network that classifies images as real or fake, using LeakyReLU activation functions to avoid the dying ReLU problem. The generator, on the other hand, creates images from random noise, employing transposed convolutions to generate 28x28 pixel images of the digit.

The training process involves a two-step approach. Initially, the discriminator is trained to distinguish real images from generated ones, using a mix of both. Then, the generator is trained to improve its ability to produce convincing images that can fool the discriminator. The generator and discriminator are trained alternately in a process known as adversarial training. Throughout the training, the performance of the discriminator is monitored, while the generator gradually becomes better at producing more realistic images.

By the end of the training, the generated images of the digit '8' have shown significant improvements, going from blurry and indistinct to clear and recognizable. This project demonstrates the power of GANs in generating realistic images from scratch, while also highlighting the iterative nature of adversarial training.
